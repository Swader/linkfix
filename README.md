# Linkfix

This extension adds a "Copy Link" button to Google Search results, so you can copy their actual value, and not the Google-enforced referral link-salad.

Accepting contributions for beautification of links.

## FAQ

Q: How do I install it?

A: Download and "Load Unpacked Extension" from the Extension screen in Google Chrome, or via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coemcogghfnepgjbahhpjmkcoiihldpa).

Q: Why not replace links and avoid need for button?

A: Because it would sabotage Google's tracking efforts. Whether it's morally fine to do so, or to *not* do so, is a discussion that's outside the scope of this extension's existence. Feel free to submit a PR that lets people toggle the "mode" - button only vs. replace links with actual value

Q: How do I make sense of the logic in this extension?

A: See SitePoint tutorial in which it is described in detail. (coming soon)
